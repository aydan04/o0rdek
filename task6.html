    <h1>Introducing AlgoCoin</h1>
    <p>The future of decentralized meme currency is here.</p>
    <h1 style="font-size: 135%;">What is AlgoCoin?</h1>
    <p > AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary <b> proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm</b>  
        that will absolutely transform the way we think about currency and catapult the
        metaverse to its next major stage: <var>Web 4.0</var>  Using AlgoCoin is simple. Instead of
        hoarding capital in wallets with forgotten passwords, earn AlgoCoin at the time
        of usage through our unique point-of-sale system. Each inverted binary tree
        equates to one AlgoCoin. This means if your chicken tenders cost 420
        AlgoCoin, all you need to do is invert 420 binary trees.
        
        </p>
      
        <h1>Where Do l start?</h1>
      <p  >Getting started with AlgoCoin is as easy as reversing a linked list. We
        recommend starting out by practicing on <a href="#">AlgoExpert.</a>  Next, once you feel
        you can invert binary trees as well as an Ex-FAANG 10x engineer, it's
        time to ditch your fiat currency and enter the future. </p>
